= Setting up a cluster using Ansible

So in this document we're going to look at how we can
automate the installation of a Kubernetes cluster using
Ansible.

For that we first need to
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-specific-operating-systems[install Ansible].

After we've done that we need to add a couple of module "collections" by running:

```
$ ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix community.general community.kubernetes
```

After that installing/updating the cluster is simply done with:

```
$ ansible-playbook k8s-kubeadm.yml -i hosts
```
